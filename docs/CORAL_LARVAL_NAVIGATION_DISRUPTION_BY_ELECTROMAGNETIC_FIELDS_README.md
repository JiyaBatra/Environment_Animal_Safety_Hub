## Issue #2395: Studying Interference from Submarine Cables

## Overview

The proliferation of submarine cables for global telecommunications and power transmission generates electromagnetic fields (EMFs) that may interfere with the navigation and settlement behaviors of coral larvae. This document examines the potential mechanisms of EMF interference, assesses current scientific evidence, and explores the ecological implications for coral reef ecosystems. The analysis focuses on how anthropogenic electromagnetic pollution could disrupt critical life history stages of reef-building corals.
