# Coral Reef Soundscape Degradation - Issue #2442

## Overview

This educational feature explores how anthropogenic noise pollution disrupts the acoustic environment of coral reefs, leading to larval settlement failure and reef regeneration challenges. Coral larvae rely on natural sound cues to locate suitable settlement sites, but increasing ocean noise from human activities masks these critical acoustic signals.

## Scientific Background

### Coral Larval Acoustic Orientation
Coral larvae exhibit remarkable acoustic sensitivity, using low-frequency sounds (20-500 Hz) to:
- Detect reef structure and complexity
- Navigate towards suitable settlement substrates
- Avoid unsuitable or degraded habitats
- Synchronize settlement with optimal environmental conditions

### Anthropogenic Noise Sources
Major sources of coral reef acoustic degradation include:
- Commercial shipping and vessel traffic
- Underwater construction and pile driving
- Seismic exploration activities
- Military sonar operations
- Coastal development and dredging

### Ecological Consequences
Acoustic degradation leads to:
- Reduced larval settlement success rates
- Altered species composition on reefs
- Decreased reef regeneration capacity
- Long-term shifts in coral community structure
- Increased vulnerability to other stressors
