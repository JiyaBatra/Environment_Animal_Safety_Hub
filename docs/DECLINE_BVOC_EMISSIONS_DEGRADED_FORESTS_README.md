# DECLINE OF BIOGENIC VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (BVOCs) IN DEGRADED FORESTS AND THEIR ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY FEEDBACKS

## Overview

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are a diverse group of organic compounds emitted by plants, including isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. These compounds play essential roles in plant defense, communication, and atmospheric chemistry. Forest degradation, resulting from deforestation, fragmentation, pollution, and climate change, significantly reduces BVOC emissions. This decline has cascading effects on atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate regulation.

## Scientific Findings

Recent studies have documented substantial reductions in BVOC emissions from degraded forests:

- **Emission Reductions**: Research indicates that degraded tropical forests emit 20-50% less BVOCs compared to intact forests. For instance, a study in the Amazon rainforest showed isoprene emissions dropping by up to 40% in logged areas (Kuhn et al., 2007).

- **Species-Specific Impacts**: Monoterpene emissions from coniferous forests decline more sharply than isoprene from broadleaf trees due to differences in emission mechanisms and plant stress responses.

- **Global Estimates**: The IPCC AR6 report highlights that land-use changes, including forest degradation, contribute to altered BVOC budgets, affecting regional air quality and climate feedbacks.

- **Measurement Techniques**: Advances in eddy covariance and PTR-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry) have enabled precise quantification of BVOC fluxes, revealing temporal and spatial variability in degraded ecosystems.

## Mechanisms of Emission Reduction

Several physiological and ecological mechanisms drive the decline in BVOC emissions:

- **Reduced Plant Biomass**: Deforestation and degradation decrease leaf area index (LAI), directly reducing the surface area for emissions.

- **Photosynthetic Stress**: Drought, nutrient limitation, and elevated CO2 levels inhibit photosynthesis, limiting carbon allocation to BVOC production.

- **Species Composition Changes**: Degradation favors stress-tolerant species with lower BVOC emission capacities, such as grasses over trees.

- **Enzymatic Regulation**: Enzymes like isoprene synthase are downregulated under stress, reducing emission rates.

- **Microbial Interactions**: Altered soil microbiomes in degraded forests may indirectly affect BVOC emissions through changes in plant health.

## Environmental Impacts

The decline in BVOC emissions has multifaceted environmental consequences:

- **Atmospheric Chemistry**: BVOCs are precursors to tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Reduced emissions lead to lower ozone concentrations in some regions, potentially improving air quality but altering oxidative capacity.

- **Air Quality**: In urban-adjacent forests, BVOC reductions can decrease SOA formation, affecting particulate matter levels and visibility.

- **Ecosystem Services**: BVOCs contribute to plant-insect interactions and defense against herbivores. Their decline may increase pest pressures on remaining vegetation.

- **Biodiversity**: Changes in BVOC profiles can disrupt pollinator attraction and plant communication, impacting forest regeneration.

## Potential Climate Implications

BVOC emissions influence climate through several feedback mechanisms:

- **Cloud Formation**: BVOCs form SOA that act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), promoting cloud formation and precipitation. Reduced emissions in degraded forests may lead to fewer clouds, altering rainfall patterns and exacerbating drought in already stressed ecosystems.

- **Radiative Forcing**: SOA scatters sunlight, providing a cooling effect. Declines in BVOC-derived SOA could reduce this negative forcing, potentially warming the climate.

- **Carbon Cycle Feedbacks**: Degraded forests have altered carbon sequestration, and reduced BVOC emissions may indicate broader metabolic disruptions affecting net primary productivity.

- **Climate Change Mitigation**: Intact forests' BVOC emissions contribute to climate regulation; their loss represents a missed opportunity for natural climate solutions.
