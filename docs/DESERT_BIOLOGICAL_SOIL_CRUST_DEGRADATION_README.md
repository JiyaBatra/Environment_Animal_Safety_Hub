# Desert Biological Soil Crust Degradation

## Issue #2476: Investigate Carbon and Nitrogen Fixation Losses

### Executive Summary

Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are complex communities of cyanobacteria, lichens, mosses, and other microorganisms that form a living skin on desert soils. These crusts play critical roles in carbon sequestration, nitrogen fixation, soil stabilization, and water retention in arid ecosystems. However, widespread degradation from anthropogenic activities, climate change, and land use changes is causing significant losses in these ecosystem services, particularly carbon and nitrogen fixation. This degradation threatens desert ecosystem stability and contributes to global biogeochemical cycles disruption.

### Scientific Background

#### Biocrust Composition and Function

Biological soil crusts consist of multiple functional groups:

**Cyanobacteria (Blue-Green Algae):**
- Primary colonizers of bare desert soils
- Photosynthetic carbon fixation
- Nitrogen fixation capabilities
- Produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) for soil binding

**Lichens:**
- Symbiotic associations of fungi and cyanobacteria/green algae
- Enhanced nitrogen fixation in later successional stages
- Carbon sequestration through fungal biomass
- Drought-resistant structures

**Mosses and Liverworts:**
- Higher water retention capacity
- Carbon storage in biomass
- Contribute to soil organic matter accumulation
- Facilitate seed germination and establishment

**Microfungi and Bacteria:**
- Decomposition and nutrient cycling
- Mycorrhizal associations with vascular plants
- Pathogen resistance

#### Ecosystem Services

**Carbon Cycle Role:**
- Primary production in arid ecosystems
- Carbon sequestration: 0.1-1.0 kg C m⁻² year⁻¹
- Soil organic carbon stabilization
- Contribution to global carbon sink

**Nitrogen Cycle Role:**
- Biological nitrogen fixation: 1-10 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹
- Nitrogen input to nutrient-poor desert soils
- Support for vascular plant communities
- Prevention of nitrogen loss through erosion

**Hydrological Functions:**
- Water retention and infiltration enhancement
- Runoff reduction and sediment trapping
- Soil moisture conservation

**Soil Stabilization:**
- Prevention of wind and water erosion
- Dust emission control
- Landscape stabilization
