# Pollinator Foraging Distance Expansion - Issue #2441

## Overview

This educational feature examines how habitat fragmentation forces pollinators to travel greater distances between food resources, leading to increased energetic stress and population declines. As natural landscapes are divided by agriculture, urbanization, and infrastructure, pollinators must expend more energy foraging, which can reduce their reproductive success, increase mortality rates, and disrupt pollination services essential for ecosystems and agriculture.

## Issue Reference
- **GitHub Issue**: #2441

- **Population Viability Charts**: Graphs showing extinction risk under various fragmentation levels
- **Connectivity Networks**: Visual representations of habitat patches and movement corridors

## Scientific Background

Habitat fragmentation increases the distance pollinators must travel between floral resources, leading to:

- **Increased Energy Expenditure**: Longer flights consume more metabolic energy
- **Reduced Reproductive Success**: Less time and energy available for mating and nesting
- **Higher Predation Risk**: Extended exposure during travel
- **Population Isolation**: Reduced gene flow between fragmented populations
- **Altered Foraging Behavior**: Changes in flower visitation patterns and preferences

## Key Research Findings

1. Bumblebees in fragmented landscapes fly 2-3 times farther than in continuous habitats
2. Energy costs can reduce colony growth by 20-50% in highly fragmented areas
3. Small habitat patches (<1 ha) support fewer pollinator species
4. Connectivity corridors can reduce foraging distances by up to 60%

## Implementation Notes

This feature integrates with the existing environmental monitoring dashboard, providing users with tools to:
- Assess local habitat fragmentation
- Predict impacts on pollinator communities
- Design mitigation strategies
- Monitor conservation effectiveness

The interactive components use real ecological data and validated models to provide accurate educational content while maintaining engagement through gamification elements.
